mace is a very nice network but last I checked it does not working properly in our implementation, we try to simulate larger systems but we only seem to obtain qualitative accuracy and nothing else, we need to be able to obtain quantitative accuracy else we will not have anything to show for it.

The network has been show to be very much more accurate than other networks but still
remains to be so for our experiments, the question remains is this because of our
own ignorance about the problem of application we're attempting ? 

Out goal is to train mace on fragmented data and hope that the system will be able to 
perform the same when we inference on larger systems outside of the distribution of
our dataset interms of system size, but it seems that at least
