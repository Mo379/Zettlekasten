# DynamicProgrammingInRL

- dynamic programming is a complexity reducing solution to exponential iterative proccesses
- In dynamic programming we break the big problem into sub problems, 
- and we utilise memory and carry over to solve the next problem in our subproblem tree,
- This is more efficent than purely recrusive methods.
