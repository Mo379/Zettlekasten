# AutomaticDifferentiation
Automatic differentiation, breaks your function down to a computational graph, using this, it can then use the known derivatives of fundemental components to obtain the [[PartialDerivatives]]. 

The computational graph allows you to automatically carry out the chain rule for the calculated derivative of each component.
