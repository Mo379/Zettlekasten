# PeriodicBoundaryConditionsInMDSimulations

Periodic boundary conditions are needed because,
- In our simulation, the % of atoms interacting with vacuum is significant,
- while in reality the % is neglible,
- this is due to the fact that the simulation cannot simulate as many atoms as what is present in reality, imagine trying to simulate a glass of water.

This simple fact means that our system is not realistic, and to solve this we need to use periodic boundary conditions.
