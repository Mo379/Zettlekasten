The probability density function can be derived from the derivative of [[CumilativeDistributionFunction]] of a continuious random variable.

The derivative of the CDF gives you the rate of change of the CDF with small changes in x. 

"from a function of probability sum to a funciton of general probability change"

then when we integrate the PDF we get back a specific sum of areas of the distribution, instead of a non general CDF area defined below a specific point.
