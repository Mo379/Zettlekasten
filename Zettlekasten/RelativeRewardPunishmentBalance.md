# RelativeRewardPunishmentBalance

- The reward and punishment must be balanced, this is a relative scaling problem.
- If the punishment is too great the agent learns to avoid the punsihment and may take too long to discover rewarding beahviours.
- If the punishment is too low the agent may take too long to learn to avoid punishing behaviours.
