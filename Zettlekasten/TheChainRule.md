# TheChainRule
The chain rule is a bad name for this, Think more like an obion rule, where you want to differentiate something that has a function INSIDE of another function. The chain idea comes when looking at the mathematics.

```ad-note
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du} \times \frac{du}{dx}$$
```

```ad-example
Given:
$$y = (x^2 + 4x)^3$$
let:
$$u = x^2 + 4x$$
and therefore:
$$y = u^3 $$

We proceed by differentiating u wrt x, and y wrt u, to obtain the multiplicative components of the chain rule, following that operation we substitute the value of u into our final expression
