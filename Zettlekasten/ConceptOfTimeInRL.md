# ConceptOfTimeInRL

- Because Rl progresses as a sequence of actions, states and rewards, we require some notion of time.

- Discrete time is counted from 0,1,2,3... to infinity or termination at a specific time (e.g t=150).
- Continuous time is counted continuesly and is more akin to real world problems.
- We can effectively turn continuous time into discrete time by chunking.
