# TheRewards

- The Reward is the main idea powering reinforcement learning.
- We encode the objective in rewards or punishments, a punishment is just a negative reward.
- This tells the agent weather its actions in a given state are good or bad.
- The rewards are singals sent to the agent by the environment

- For the dog, this can be a reward for doing the right thing or a punishment for misbehaving.
- Dopamine release in the human brain when winning a piece in chess.
- Binary right or wrong choice for a robot.

- The goal of RL becomes to maximise the reward instead of just 'achieveing the objective', this is a generalisation, allowing us to be able to solve many problems using the same algorithm (advanced).
