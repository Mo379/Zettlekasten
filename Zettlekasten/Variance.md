# Variance
The variance of a distribtuion of a random variable is the measure of the spread or dispersion or said distribution. Measure in the unites of X squared.

```ad-important
The rth central moment of a random variable X:
$$
E[(X-E(X))^r] = E[(X-\mu x)^r]
$$
Where the variance is the second central moment of a distribution:
$$
\sigma_x^2 = Var(X) = E[(X-\mu x)^2]
$$
```

see [[PropertiesOfVariance]]
