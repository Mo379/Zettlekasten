# MomentsOfRandomVariables

The moment of a random variable, is the expected value of a power of the random variable or of a function of the random variable.

```ad-important
The general notaiton is as follows:
$$
\text{moment}(r,f(X,...)) = 
E(f^r)
$$
where r is a constant used to raise to a power, f is a function of the random variable along with other parameters.

```ad-warning
The function f could simply be the random variable it self, see the mean, which is a moment of the random variable, such that the fucntion f is simply X.
```


Examples of moments of random variables and functions of random variables include:

1) [[Mean]]
3) [[TheCentralMoment]] -> [[Variance]] -> [[StandardDeviation]]
4) [[TheFactorialMoment]]
