# CumilativeDistributionFunction
Given a random variable and its distribution, we want to know the probability that that random variable takes a value less that or equal to some value.

```ad-important
This can be thought of as the probability of a subset of outcomes of the ordered samplespace. This exists for both conineous and discrete random variables.
