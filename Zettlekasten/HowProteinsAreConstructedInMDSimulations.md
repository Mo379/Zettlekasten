# HowProteinsAreConstructedInMDSimulations

A molecular dynamics simulator is generalised,  such that you can simulate any particle system you want, therefore if you would like to simulate a protein you have to know how to create the protein system itself within the simulation.

This means the positions of the different atoms and their types have to be provided, along with other initial properties such as velocities, mass and momenta.
