This is the soft landing, you want a program or book that softly introduces you and guides you into the language.

This is copuled with a review method to help you stay active in consuming the langage. It's key to also make this process fun, you watching shows in the language with subtitles, changing your phone's default language and listening to music in that language should be sufficent.

```ad-note
Reading beginner books, listening to beginner lessons, and learning the top 1000-1500 words for that language. 

The word list is the dry, and books and listening is the soft giving you: 

soft + dry = win
```

```ad-important
It's important to get the volume of consumption right, for the books, videos and how many words to write down per day etc.
