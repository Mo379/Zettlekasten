# LearnForCriticalThinking
You have to strive to learn, both analytically and in leadership skills, this will set you as a good example for people to follow.

A second point is to debreif both wins and losses, if you debrief you get to understand the behaviour that lead you to win, and if new actions were undertaken this leads to better future straties, and similr for failures.

De-breifing is the process of understnading why somthing happend...we won ? why did we win ? what did we do to win ? what did we have to avoid to win ? etc etc...
