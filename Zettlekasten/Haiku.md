Haiku is a jax framework that allows you to more efficently create jax networks using object oriented programming.

```ad-important
Haiku works up to the point where your 'transform' you haiku moduels to [[JaxInit]] and [[JaxApply]] functions, from there it's standard training procedure.
```

```ad-note
Haiku abstracts away the intrecate funcitonal programming, by allowing us to classes for layers and to then compose those classes in a smaller function to create a network.
