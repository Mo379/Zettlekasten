# AbsoluteStatesAndStateRepresentations

- The state we provide to our agent, could be an absolute state, or a state representation.
- An absolute state is a set of numbers, for grid world, this can be the current position of the agent, and the exit position.
- A state representation is a vector that represents the state, for grid world this could be the output of a convolutional neural network looking at the screen.
