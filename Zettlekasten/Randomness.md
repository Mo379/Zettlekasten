# Randomness
Randomness is the aparant lack of a pattern in a particular set sequence, e.g events, symbols, colors, sizes etc. (We say random outcomes of experiments)

In randomness there is a lack of order and therefore by definition random events are unpredictable, furthermore, if a probability distribution is known or derived for this random sequence then, the frequencey of different outcomes over repeated events is predictable.

```ad-important
Randomness follows a pattern in the global scale, that pattern is the distribution.
