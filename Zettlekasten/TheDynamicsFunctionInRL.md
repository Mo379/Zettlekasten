# TheDynamicsFunctionInRL

- the dynamics function tells us how the environment responds to actions.
- It gives us the states or set of states with probabilities, depending on the action we take in the environment at this time step.
- If the environment is deterministic we get a single state back with a probability of 1.0
- if the environment is non-deterministic, we get many states with different probabilities.
