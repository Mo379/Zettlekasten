# TheFactorialMoment

Is a quantaty defined as the expected or average value of the [[TheFallingFactorial]] of a random variable. 

```ad-note
The rth factorial moment of a random variable is defined as: 

$$
E(X^{\underline{r}})
$$

with the falling factorial being defined as: 

$$
(x)_n = x^{\underline{n}} = 
x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-n+1)
$$
```

```ad-quote
Factorial moments are useful for studying non-negative intiger valued random variables, and arise in the use of probability-generating functions to derive the moments of discrete random variables.

Factorial moments serve as analytic tools in the mathematical field of combinatorics, which is the study of discrete mathematical structures.
