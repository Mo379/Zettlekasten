# ProblemsWithClassicalMD

The Quantum (DFT) accuracy of simulation remain in-accessibe for many large scale systems, and is inherently costly to compute due to exponential complexity with the number of molecules in the system.

when we lower the resolution of the system we obtain a representation that is easier to compute, however, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy when calculating the potentials.
