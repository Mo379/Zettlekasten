# ProblemsWithClassicalMD

The Quantum (DFT) resolution of simulation remain in-accessibe for many large scale systems, and is inherintly costly to compute due to exponential complexity with the number of molecules in the sytem.

when we lower the resolution of the system we obtain a representaiton that is easier to compute, however, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy when calculating the potentials.
