This is the engagement level, where you have to output instead of consume, meaning you have to practice speaking and basic forms of writing. Speaking is a skill within itself so you have to practice it, this should last for 1-3 months.

This should be coupled with an increase in intensity, for example, when watching tv shows, remove the english subtitles and instead use the target language's subtitle.

This can take 2-4 months.

At this stage you begin to stick the langague into your head.
