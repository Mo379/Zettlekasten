# RandomVariable
A random variabels is a mathematical formalisation of a quantaty or object, that depends on an [[experiment]].

```ad-warning
Dont confuse an experiment with a random process, tossing a coin is a random process and can be an experiment, tossing a coin 3 times is a random process repeated 3 times to produce 1 run of an experiment
```

```ad-example
The OUTCOME of a coint toss, is a quantaty that depends on the random process of tossing a coin. 
```

In the case of a coin the random variable is discrete, however, some other random variable could be said to be continuous.
