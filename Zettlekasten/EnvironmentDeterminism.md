# EnvironmentDeterminism

- An environment could either be deterministic or non deterministic.
- If an environment is deterministic the action taken will always put you in the same state. (e.g chess is deterministic if you decide to movie a piece)
- If an environment is non deterministic, the actions taken may somtimes point you to different states with varying probabilites. (e.g a robot's action to pick something up may fail, or succeed due to physical complexity)
