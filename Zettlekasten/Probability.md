# Probability
Probability is the measure of likeliness that an event or outcome of a random variable will occur. This measure is obtained as a [[Ratios]] between two numbers, i.e a size comparison. This size comparison is between the size of the outcome or event and the size of the [[SampleSpace]].

```ad-important
Probability takes a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates absolute certainty that an event will occur, and zero indicating absolute certainty that it will not.
