1) In english we already use a lot of french, where
formal sounding words are latin, and casual sounding words are germanic e.g to ask and to enquire.
- to ask is germanic
- to enquire is latin and so it's like french 


gâteau -> cake
caffe -> coffe

le gâteau -> the cake
le caffe -> the coffe

je veux -> I want
veux is connected to volenteer, a volenteer is one who wants to do, theyre doing something just out of want (want= veux)

je vous le gâteau -> i want the cake
je vous le caffe -> i want the coffe

The word for (it) is the same as the word for (the).
I want it -> je la veux -literal> i it want
Notice how in french the word for it and want are fipped when compared to enlish.

tu veux -> you want
tu veux le gâteau -> you want the cake

to ask a question in french you make the sentence sound like a question.
tu veux le gâteau ? -> do you want the cake ? 
tu veux le caffe ? -> do you want the coffe ?
tu le veux ? -> do you want it ? 

You can convert huge groups of words from english to french, words ending in (ion) are from latin origin, and hence they would spell and sound the same in frech.
Education -> Education -> edu-ca-sion
Collection -> Collection -> collec-sion
Organisation -> Orginisation ->
etc...

The words or nouns in french have a feminie or masculine meaning, this changes which leading refferal word we use either (le -> feminie),  or (la -> masculine).
le gâteau -> the cake -> feminine
le caffee -> the coffe -> feminine
la collection -> the collection -> masculine
la confirmaiton -> the confirmation -> masculine

The word for (it) is the same as the word for (the), la and le for masculine and feminine.
je veux la confirmation -> i want the confirmation
tu veux la collection -> you want the collection
je voux le caffee ->
tu voux le gateau -> 
tu la veux -> you want it
tu la veux ? -> do you want it ? 

To know if a word is feminine or masculine you can generalise, words ending in ion are usually masculine and so on... this comes with practice

Losing the (a) or (e) and replacing it with an apostrophe depends on if the noun in question starts with a voul (**a, e, i, o, u and y**), and the pronounciation changes a bit.
(O)pinion -> (O)pinion
la opinion -> the opinion 
l'opinion -> the opinion
l'passion -> the passion
l'organisation -> the organisation
