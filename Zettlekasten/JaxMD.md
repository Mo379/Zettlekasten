# JaxMD

Jax MD is similar to other software that allows you to run molecular dynamics simulations, it's a library that offers many supporting functions to create a physical environment for simulations. Aditionally, it's got a primary objective to allow neural network assisted simulations.



$$
\mathrm{log\_softmax}(x) = \log \left( \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j \exp(x_j)} \right)
