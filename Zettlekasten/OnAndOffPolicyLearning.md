# OnAndOffPolicyLearning

- Off-policy learning is when the actions taken are generated using a policy different to the one we are trying to learn, and we iterate with the help of exploration.
- On-policy learning updates the same policy that is used to produce trajectories
- We need markov decision processes to fully understand on and off policy learning.
