# ConditionalProbability

Conditional probability of an event given another event, can be understood as a reduction of the sample space, and then a simple probability calculation.

```ad-note
The conditional probability of A given B, is the [[Probability]] using [[Ratios]] of the part of the reduced sample space D which belongs to A, where D = B.
