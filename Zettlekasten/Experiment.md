# Experiment
An experimnet is a trial of the random process governing a random variable.

```ad-warning
Dont confuse an experiment with a random process, tossing a coin is a random process and can be an experiment, tossing a coin 3 times is a random process repeated 3 times to produce 1 run of an experiment
```
