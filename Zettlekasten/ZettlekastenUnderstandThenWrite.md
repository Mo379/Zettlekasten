# zettlekastenUnderstandThenWrite

The idea of zettlekasten is to collect ideas [[zettlekastenCard]], however, what's more important is to understand before you write things down, this is easy because you're looking for atomic ideas to write down in the first place, so by definition, those ideas should fit right into your brain, however, it's also important to avoid the trap of copying things down.
