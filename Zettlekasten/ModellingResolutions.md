# ModellingResolutions

We can represent a physical system under investigation with different resolutions, each resolution has it's own ups and downs.

There are 4 main resolutions we care about,:
- Quantum: Timescale-> fs-ps, Size-> pm-nm
- All-atom:  Timescale-> ps-ns, Size-> nm-um
- Coarse-grained:  Timescale-> ns-s, Size-> nm-mm
- mesoscale:  Timescale-> ps-s, Size-> mm-m
