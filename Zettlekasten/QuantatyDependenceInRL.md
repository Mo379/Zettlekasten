# QuantatyDependenceInRL

- This chain of sequence creates a dependence, where the latter state depends on the one before it, this applies for each state that has an ancestor.
- This is natural given the setup of the RL control problem.
- The action taken only depends on the current state of the system and nothing else.
- This is an important distinction to make.
