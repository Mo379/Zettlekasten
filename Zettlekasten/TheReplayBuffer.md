# TheReplayBuffer

- using a replay buffer is generally an off policy learning method,
- Instead of discarding the trajectory we save it for later use for learning,
- the future of an exploratory step is not generated using the policy we have now, but with the police we will have after evaluation, we can use this fact for learning.
