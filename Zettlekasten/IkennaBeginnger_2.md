This stage begins after you have finished the 1000-1500 words, and after having read and understood a beginner text book in that language.


```ad-important
This stage is about reading, the goal is to find and read easy reading material, resources for this can be below.


```

Reading will get a lot of vocab in your head, as well, and reading graphical novels will help with comprehension when you dont understand words.

Couples with reading, you want a resource to help you learn the grammar of the language, this can be found either on a youtube channel, a small course or some kind of text book.

```ad-warning
All of this should be done as you're also applying the strategies from the previous stage.
