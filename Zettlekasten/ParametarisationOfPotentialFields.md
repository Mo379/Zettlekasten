# ParametarisationOfPotentialFields

When we are simulating a physical system, we really want to know how every molecule moves, we do this by calculating the energy using the sum of individual interactions for each atom.

It's important to know that In practice, this is done using a parameter file, this includes the parameters that we use to calculate the total energy that each particle experinces.

$$
E_{\text{total}} = 

E_{\text{bond}} + E_{\text{angle}} + E_{\text{DIH}} + 
E_{\text{LJ}} + E_{\text{coulomb}}
$$

Each term in the above equation has parameter values that detrmine the energy it currently has, we this energy to calculate the potential and or force that we need to know how the particle moves in our simulation.
