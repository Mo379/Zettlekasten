# TheValue

- The value function adresses an important question: What is a state or action in a state worth ? 
- There are two types of values that can be obtained from the RL setup, we can phrase those in questions.
- How good is it to be in each state ?
- How good is it to take an action in a particular state ? 
- the value function is tightly linked to the return, which encodes the idea of the past.
