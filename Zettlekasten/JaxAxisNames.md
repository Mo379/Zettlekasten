# JaxAxisNames
In jax it is useful in many different senarios to provide an array axis a specific name, this will make dealing with computation a lot easier and make the code cleaner.

```ad-example
When trying to calculate the mean over a computation that occured in parallel over many devices, it is useful to know the name of the axis common with all. see [[JaxPmean]]
