# ClassicalProteinMolecularDynamicsOutline

It's generally a great Idea to understand how classical molecular dynamics is done, this should then give a clearer pathway as to how you could Integrate the methodology using other simulation packages such as Jax-MD as well as giving you an idea of how to include machine learning models into the pipeline.

generally speaking it's good to learn how everything works.
