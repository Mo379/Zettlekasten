# MeanSquaredErrorLoss
The mean squared error is a very simple loss function, it takes the form: 
```ad-important
$$ l = MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i-\hat{y_i})^2$$

This takes the ouputs from each neural network and uses the ground truth labels to obtain a measure of how accurate the outputs are.
```
