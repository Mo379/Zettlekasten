# TheFallingFactorial

```ad-note
The falling factorial is a polynomial in mathematics defined as: 

$$
(x)_n = x^{\underline{n}} = 
x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-n+1)
$$
$$
= \prod_{k=1}^{n} (x-k+1)
$$

```

Furthermore we can also define the rising factorial where instead of falling terms of x, we get rising terms x(x+1)(x+2)...
