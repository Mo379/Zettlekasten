   abstract = {We survey research on self-driving cars published in the literature focusing on autonomous cars developed since the DARPA challenges, which are equipped with an autonomy system that can be categorized as SAE level 3 or higher. The architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars is typically organized into the perception system and the decision-making system. The perception system is generally divided into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as self-driving-car localization, static obstacles mapping, moving obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and recognition, among others. The decision-making system is commonly partitioned as well into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as route planning, path planning, behavior selection, motion planning, and control. In this survey, we present the typical architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars. We also review research on relevant methods for perception and decision making. Furthermore, we present a detailed description of the architecture of the autonomy system of the self-driving car developed at the Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), named Intelligent Autonomous Robotics Automobile (IARA). Finally, we list prominent self-driving car research platforms developed by academia and technology companies, and reported in the media.},

   abstract = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC—called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) — deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X – 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X – 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.},

   abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

   abstract = { Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text. },

   abstract = {By the end of the kindergarten, students are expected to possess early academic skills as well as the social maturity to be successful in first grade. Students leaving kindergarten without these readiness skills are sometimes held back in first grade or referred for a special education evaluation in later grades if they fail to make adequate progress. However, before a special education referral can be made, the education system must demonstrate that the deficit is not due to a lack of instruction. Response-to-Intervention is a preventive intervention framework supported by federal legislation (No Child Left Behind (NCLB); 2002 and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEIA); 2004) that ensures that only valid special education referrals (i.e., referrals based on quantitative data) are processed. Using a multi-tiered assessment and intervention approach, students are first identified as at-risk through the use of screening tools designed to indicate academic or behavioral deficits. At-risk students are then exposed to evidence-based interventions with increasing levels of intensity to determine the type and amount of support needed. However, response-to-intervention has yet to be extended down to kindergarten students, and the screening instruments available for this population have yet to be evaluated for their predictive validity with end of first grade academic and behavioral performance. This study examines the predictive validity of psychometrically sound academic and behavioral screening instruments with first grade academic and social-emotional success. Participants included kindergarten students (n = 290) from five ethnically diverse elementary schools located in a small suburban city in a mid-Atlantic state. Early literacy, early numeracy, writing, and social-emotional screening assessments were administered three times a year to determine whether the screening tools were adequate measures of kindergarten readiness skills for first grade academic and social-emotional success. Participants were followed from the beginning of kindergarten until the end of first grade to determine which skills measured by the screening assessments were the most predictive of a conceptual model of first grade academic and social-emotional success. The results indicated that the social-emotional screening assessment was able to significantly predict social-emotional success at the end of first grade. Kindergarten academic screening assessments however, were not able to significantly predict first grade academic success. Results also indicated that there were significant differences in scores across gender, ethnicity and family composition.

   abstract = {Biological membranes play an essential role in the cellular protection as well as in the control and the transport of nutrients. Many mechanisms such as molecular recognition, enzymatic catalysis, cellular adhesion and membrane fusion take place into the biological membranes. In 1972, Singer et al. provided a membrane model, called fluid mosaic model, in which each leaflet of the bilayer is formed by a homogeneous environment of lipids in a fluid state including globular assembling of proteins and glycoproteins. Since its conception in 1972, many developments were brought to this model in terms of composition and molecular organization. The main development of the fluid mosaic model was made by Simons et al. (1997) and Brown et al. (1997) who suggested that membrane lipids are organized into lateral microdomains (or lipid rafts) with a specific composition and a molecular dynamic that are different to the composition and the dynamic of the surrounding liquid crystalline phase. The discovery of a phase separation in the plane of the membrane has induced an explosion in the research efforts related to the biology of cell membranes but also in the development of new technologies for the study of these biological systems. Due to the high complexity of biological membranes and in order to investigate the biological processes that occur on the membrane surface or within the membrane lipid bilayer, a large number of studies are performed using biomimicking model membranes. This paper aims at revisiting the fundamental properties of biological membranes in terms of membrane composition, membrane dynamic and molecular organization, as well as at describing the most common biomimicking models that are frequently used for investigating biological processes such as membrane fusion, membrane trafficking, pore formation as well as membrane interactions at a molecular level. Des membranes biologiques aux modèles membranaires biomimétiques. Les membranes biologiques jouent un rôle essentiel dans la protection cellulaire ainsi que dans le contrôle et le transport des éléments nutritifs. Elles sont le lieu de nombreux mécanismes biologiques tels que la reconnaissance moléculaire, la catalyse enzymatique, l'adhésion cellulaire ou encore la fusion membranaire. En 1972, Singer et al. ont proposé un modèle membranaire, appelé modèle de la mosaïque fluide. Selon ce modèle, les membranes biologiques consistent en des bicouches lipidiques dynamiques renfermant des protéines et des glycoprotéines. Les protéines membranaires forment des icebergs globulaires dans une mer homogène de lipides à l'état fluide. Depuis sa conception, le modèle de la mosaïque fluide a fortement évolué notamment suite aux travaux de Simons et al. (1997) et de Brown et al. (1997). Ces chercheurs ont montré que les lipides membranaires sont en réalité organisés en microdomaines (rafts lipidiques) dont la composition et la dynamique moléculaire sont bien spécifiques et différentes de celles de la phase liquide cristalline formée par les phospholipides environnants. Une telle découverte a entrainé un intérêt sans cesse croissant pour l'étude des membranes biologiques et a provoqué par la même occasion une émergence de nouvelles technologies de pointe pour améliorer nos connaissances sur ces systèmes biologiques extrêmement complexes. Aussi, en raison de la grande complexité des membranes biologiques, la plupart des études ciblant les mécanismes biologiques qui se déroulent à la surface des membranes ou au sein de leur bicouche lipidique sont réalisées en utilisant des modèles membranaires biomimétiques. Cette synthèse a donc pour principaux objectifs de revisiter les propriétés de base des membranes biologiques en termes de composition membranaire, de dynamique membranaire et d'organisation moléculaire, ainsi que de décrire les modèles membranaires les plus couramment utilisés pour étudier des mécanismes biologiques tels que la fusion membranaire, le transport membranaire, la formation de pores membranaires, ainsi que les interactions membranaires à l'échelle moléculaire.},

   abstract = {To enable MEMS designers to create fabrication-ready models of MEMS devices in an intuitive environment, this paper describes a MEMS design strategy that uses parameterized three-dimensional (3D) part features to construct geometric models of MEMS devices and then generates mask-layouts and process flows automatically. SolidWorks, an outstanding 3D design tool, is utilized to build the 3D model of the MEMS device. Most frequently-used 3D MEMS part features are created in SolidWorks and saved to a user database through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of SolidWorks. When designing a MEMS device, the designer develops its 3D model by selecting 3D part features from the database, and then uses Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to refine the model until it exhibits the desired characteristics. Next, the model is used to generate mask-layouts and process flows. Finally, it is necessary to verify whether the mask-layouts and process flows are generated correctly by reconstructing them into a 3D geometric model and comparing it to the designed 3D model. If there are differences between them, the designer is supposed to modify the mask-layouts and process flows until they can result in the desired shape of the MEMS device.},

The BLMs were prepared in a microfabricated aperture with a smoothly tapered edge, which was prepared in a nanometerthick Si3N4 septum by the wet etching method. Owing to this structure, the stress on lipid, bilayers at the contact with the septum was minimized, leading to remarkable membrane stability. The BLMs were not broken by applying a constant voltage of ±1V. The membrane lifetime was 15-45 h with and without an incorporated gramicidin channel. Gramicidin single-channel currents were recorded from the same BLM preparation when the aqueous solutions surrounding the BLM were repeatedly exchanged, demonstrating the tolerance of the present BLM to repetitive solution exchanges. Such stable membranes enable analysis of channel functions under various solution conditions from the same BLM, which will open up a variety of applications including a high throughput drug screening for ion channels. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

Because the BLM system has a high compatibility with recently developed cell-free expression systems, it has attracted attention as a next-generation drug screening system. However, three issues associated with BLM systems, i. e., their instability, the need for non-volatile organic solvents and a low efficiency of ion channel incorporation, have limited their use as a drug screening platform. In this personal account, we discuss our recent approaches to address these issues based on microfabrication. We also discuss the potential for using the BLM system combined with cell-free expression systems as a drug screening system for future personalized medicine.},

   abstract = {Background Mimicking cell membranes by simple models based on the reconstitution of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers represents a straightforward approach to understand biological function of these proteins. This biomimetic strategy has been extended to synthetic membranes that have advantages in terms of chemical and mechanical stability, thus providing more robust hybrid membranes. Scope of the review We present here how membrane proteins and biopores have been inserted both in the membrane of nanosized and microsized compartments, and in planar membranes under various conditions. Such bio-hybrid membranes have new properties (as for example, permeability to ions/molecules), and functionality depending on the specificity of the inserted biomolecules. Interestingly, membrane proteins can be functionally inserted in synthetic membranes provided these have appropriate properties to overcome the high hydrophobic mismatch between the size of the biomolecule and the membrane thickness. Major conclusion Functional insertion of membrane proteins and biopores in synthetic membranes of compartments or in planar membranes is possible by an appropriate selection of the amphiphilic copolymers, and conditions of the self-assembly process. These hybrid membranes have new properties and functionality based on the specificity of the biomolecules and the nature of the synthetic membranes. General significance Bio-hybrid membranes represent new solutions for the development of nanoreactors, artificial organelles or active surfaces/membranes that, by further gaining in complexity and functionality, will promote translational applications.

   abstract = {We present a new, robust three dimensional microfabrication method for highly parallel microfluidics, to improve the throughput of on-chip material synthesis by allowing parallel and simultaneous operation of many replicate devices on a single chip. Recently, parallelized microfluidic chips fabricated in Silicon and glass have been developed to increase the throughput of microfluidic materials synthesis to an industrially relevant scale. These parallelized microfluidic chips require large arrays (>10,000) of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) to deliver fluid from delivery channels to the parallelized devices. Ideally, these TSVs should have a small footprint to allow a high density of features to be packed into a single chip, have channels on both sides of the wafer, and at the same time minimize debris generation and wafer warping to enable permanent bonding of the device to glass. Because of these requirements and challenges, previous approaches cannot be easily applied to produce three dimensional microfluidic chips with a large array of TSVs. To address these issues, in this paper we report a fabrication strategy for the robust fabrication of three-dimensional Silicon microfluidic chips consisting of a dense array of TSVs, designed specifically for highly parallelized microfluidics. In particular, we have developed a two-layer TSV design that allows small diameter vias (d < 20 µm) without sacrificing the mechanical stability of the chip and a patterned SiO2 etch-stop layer to replace the use of carrier wafers in Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). Our microfabrication strategy allows >50,000 (d = 15 µm) TSVs to be fabricated on a single 4” wafer, using only conventional semiconductor fabrication equipment, with 100% yield (M = 16 chips) compared to 30% using previous approaches. We demonstrated the utility of these fabrication strategies by developing a chip that incorporates 20,160 flow focusing droplet generators onto a single 4” Silicon wafer, representing a 100% increase in the total number of droplet generators than previously reported. To demonstrate the utility of this chip for generating pharmaceutical microparticle formulations, we generated 5–9 µm polycaprolactone particles with a CV < 5% at a rate as high as 60 g/hr (>1 trillion particles/hour).},

In this review, we briefly analyze how the efficacy of liposomes depends on the nature of their components and their size, surface charge, and lipidic organization. Moreover, we discuss the influence of the physicochemical properties of liposomes on their interaction with cells, half-life, ability to enter tissues, and final fate in vivo. Finally, we describe some strategies developed to overcome limitations of the “first-generation” liposomes, and liposomebased drugs on the market and in clinical trials.},

   abstract = {The multifaceted role of biological membranes prompted early the development of artificial lipid-based models with a primary view of reconstituting the natural functions in vitro so as to study and exploit chemoreception for sensor engineering. Over the years, a fair amount of knowledge on the artificial lipid membranes, as both, suspended or supported lipid films and liposomes, has been disseminated and has helped to diversify and expand initial scopes. Artificial lipid membranes can be constructed by several methods, stabilized by various means, functionalized in a variety of ways, experimented upon intensively, and broadly utilized in sensor development, drug testing, drug discovery or as molecular tools and research probes for elucidating the mechanics and the mechanisms of biological membranes. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art, discusses the diversity of applications, and presents future perspectives. The newly-introduced field of artificial cells further broadens the applicability of artificial membranes in studying the evolution of life.},
